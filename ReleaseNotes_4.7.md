# HAMLIB 4.7 - Release Notes (WIP)                        2025-12-01(?)

*This is very much a first cut - nothing is set in concrete or inviolate - n3gb*

This release brings new equipment support, bug fixes/code cleanups, and some
changes to ease transition to 5.0

## New equipment support
- Yaesu FTX-1 Optima/Field - Work in progress; testers welcome.
- Drake R8/R8A/R8B - new, revised backend
- AF6SA WRC rotator
- GUOHETEC PMR-171 & Q900 moved to separate backend

## Bug fixes & code cleanups
- Codebase conforms to ISO/IEC 9899:2024 (-std=c23)
- Reduce gripes from cppcheck and other static analyzers
- Functions `rig_get_conf()`, `rot_get_conf()` and `amp_get_conf()` are deprecated and
  will be removed in 5.0. Use `..._get_conf2()` instead. See issue
  [#924](https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib/issues/924).
- Functions `rig_set_trn()` & `rig_get_trn()` deprecated; operation now handled internally.
- Documentation brought up to date.
- (TBD)

## Build/install changes
- POSIX threads(PTHREADS) support required
- Many fixes for building the optional language bindings
- C compiler - Supported compilers unchanged; c11 or c17 recommended,
  c23 optional. 5.0 will require at least c11.

## Changes for 5.0
HAMLIB 5.0 will make some major changes to the Application Binary Interface(ABI) that will
require changes to some applications, and at least recompilation/linking for all
apps. Most(all, I hope) of these source changes can be made/tested/debugged incrementally
with 4.7, making the transition much easier. The Application Programming Interface(API)
does not change.

### Storage restructuring
HAMLIB 5.0 will move many data items/structures out of rig_struct into separate heap
buffers. See issues [#487](https://github.com/Hanlib/Hamlib/issues/487),
[#1445](https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib/issues/1445), and
[#1420](https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib/issues/1420). This changes many of
the methods for accessing HAMLIB internal data. HAMLIB 4.7 marks these old methods as
"Deprecated", and supplies macros to use for forward compatibility.

### Include files
Along with the moves to separate storage, the definitions of these data structures
will be moved out of hamlib/rig.h to their own include files. These `.h` files also
define macros to get the address of said structures.

Preliminary versions of these files are also part of 4.7 for pre-emptive use.

### The good news
If your application only calls the Hamlib API routines, then nothing needs to change.
If your application only uses configuration items like names, speeds, etc, it may be
easiest to change over to using rig_set_conf(). and let Hamlib handle the internals.
